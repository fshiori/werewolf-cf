## 3. Room Options (gameOption tokens)

The PHP `game_option` field is a space-delimited string of tokens stored in the `room` table.  
CF replaces this with a typed `RoomOptions` interface (see `src/types/room-options.ts`).

| PHP Token | Description | Parsed in CF? | Consumed? | Status |
|-----------|-------------|:------------:|:---------:|--------|
| `wish_role` | Allow players to wish for a specific role | ✅ | ✅ `wishRole` | ✅ Full (join captures wishRole; start-game assignment prefers valid wishes) |
| `dummy_boy` | Include AI dummy player (替身君) | ✅ | ✅ `dummyBoy` | ⚠️ Partial (dummy player + custom last words wired; full legacy AI/speech behavior not complete) |
| `open_vote` | Reveal vote tallies to all players | ✅ | ✅ `openVote` | ✅ Full (fallbacks to anonymous vote-count mode when voteDisplay unset) |
| `real_time:D:N` | Use real-time limits (D min day, N min night) | ✅ | ✅ `realTime` + `realTimeDayLimitSec/night` | ✅ Full (supports separate day/night limits and legacy `real_time:D:N` parsing) |
| `comoutl` | 共生者夜晚對話顯示（show lover/common night whisper to others） | ✅ | ✅ `comoutl` | ✅ Full (comoutl=true: others see 「悄悄話...」; comoutl=false: hidden) |
| `vote_me` | Allow self-vote | ✅ | ✅ `voteMe` | ✅ Full (frontend target filtering + backend vote validation) |
| `trip` | Require tripcode to join | ✅ | ✅ `tripRequired` | ✅ Full (join-time enforcement in API) |
| `will` | Enable last-words (遺言) | ✅ | ✅ `will` | ✅ Full |
| `gm:XXXXX` | Designate a specific trip as GM | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ Partial (CF uses `gmEnabled` boolean for host-as-GM; PHP allows arbitrary trip) |
| `as_gm` | Activate GM role | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ Partial (GM system exists but simpler than PHP) |
| `votedisplay` | Show who has already voted (start-game & day) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ `votedisplay` | ⚠️ Partial (day-phase vote progress wired via `vote_update.votedUsers`; start-game vote flow not ported) |
| `cust_dummy` | Custom dummy-boy name/last-words | ⚠️ | ⚠️ `custDummy` + `dummyCustomName` + `dummyCustomLastWords` | ⚠️ Partial (parser/runtime 已支援；create-room UI 尚未提供完整設定控件) |

---

## 4. Role Options (optionRole tokens)

The PHP `option_role` field is a space-delimited string of tokens stored in the `room` table.  
These control which special roles appear in the role list at game start.

| PHP Token | Description | Parsed in CF? | Consumed in Role Assignment? | Status |
|-----------|-------------|:------------:|:----------------------------:|--------|
| `decide` | Add 決定者 role (tie-breaker: dies on tie) | ✅ | ✅ `decide` role exists + vote tie logic | ⚠️ Partial (role type exists; auto-add to role list at 16+ players not implemented) |
| `authority` | Add 權力者 role (2× vote weight) | ✅ | ✅ `authority` role exists + vote weight logic | ⚠️ Partial (role type exists; auto-add to role list at 16+ players not implemented) |
| `poison` | Add 埋毒者 role (wolf-team poisoner) | ✅ | ⚠️ `poison` role type exists | ⚠️ Partial (type exists; auto-add to role list at 20+ players not implemented) |
| `cat` | Poison variant: cat-style (poison = 貓又) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ Missing |
| `pobe` | Poison variant: wolf-team poisoner (pobe+poison→extra wolf+poison at 20+) | ✅ | ✅ `pobe` | ✅ Full (foxs+poison 互斥解除 + 20+ extra wolf+poison) |
| `betr` | Add 背德者 role (fox-team, wins if fox dead + wolves dead) | ✅ | ✅ `betr` role + victory condition | ⚠️ Partial (role + victory exists; auto-add at 20+ not implemented) |
| `foxs` | Add 雙狐 role (two foxes) | ✅ | ⚠️ `fox` role type exists | ⚠️ Partial (role exists; dual-fox assignment not implemented) |
| `fosi` | Add 子狐 role (fox-team sub-role) | ✅ | ✅ `fosi` role exists | ⚠️ Partial (role exists; auto-add at 20+ not implemented) |
| `wfbig` | Add 大狼 role (strong wolf) | ✅ | ⚠️ `wfbig` role type exists | ⚠️ Partial (type exists; auto-add at 20+ not implemented) |
| `lovers` | Add 戀人 role (paired lovers, die together) | ✅ | ✅ `lovers`/`lovers_partner` roles | ⚠️ Partial (roles exist; auto-replace `common` in role list not implemented) |

### PHP Role Assignment Logic (not yet ported)

In PHP, `game_vote.php` lines ~715–790 implement complex role-list mutation at game start:

1. **20+ players required**: `betr`, `poison`, `foxs`, `wfbig`, `fosi` only activate when `user_count >= 20`
2. **Mutual exclusivity**: Only one of `betr`, `foxs`, `fosi`, or plain `poison` can be active
3. **pobe + poison combo**: When both `pobe` and `poison` (or `cat`) are set, an extra wolf is added
4. **lovers replaces common**: When `lovers` is set, one `common` in the role list is replaced with `lovers`
5. **decide at 16+**: `decide` overwrites a `human` in the role list
6. **authority at 16+**: `authority` overwrites a `human` in the role list
7. **Role list tables**: PHP has per-player-count role lists for 8–30 players (`setting.php` lines 196–219)

CF has the role **types** defined but the **auto-assignment logic** that modifies the role list based on optionRole tokens is not yet fully ported.
